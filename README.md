Over the course of 2021, I worked as audit manager at ENSAE Junior Ã‰tudes, ENSAE Paris' Junior-Entreprise.

Over the course of that year, I had the opportunity to work on quite a few different documents, some of which I reformated as a .tex file.

This repository should, hopefully, save a bit of my work on these documents, for future EJE administrators to use.

I will try to create multiple anonymised versions of these documents, for future reference

Note: alot of documents use a logo: you can use any picture you'd like, so long as it is called "logo_EJE"
